    <h1>Election Forecast: 2026 Midterm Poll Shift</h1>
    <p>
      Analysts report a sudden polling shift in several swing districts. The
      late surge appears driven by higher early-vote participation and a
      concentrated ground game across a handful of competitive states.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strategists are now debating whether the senate control narrative will
      pivot before November. Observers are also watching independent turnout,
      which has historically been difficult to forecast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outcome could influence legislative priorities, with markets eyeing
      healthcare and energy policy as key themes.
