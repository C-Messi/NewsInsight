    <h1>Bitcoin Eyes $100k as ETF Flows Rise</h1>
    <p>
      Bitcoin surged following a week of strong ETF inflows, pushing BTC toward a
      critical psychological level. Traders are split on whether a clean break
      above $100k can happen before year-end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Options markets show increased open interest around the $100k strike, while
      macro traders point to rate expectations as a key variable for risk assets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next CPI print and upcoming central bank commentary are expected to
      influence sentiment in the near term.
